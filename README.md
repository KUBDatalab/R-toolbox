## R-toolbox

This is the lesson repository for R-toolbox, a collection of episodes for 
teaching various topics in R at KUB Datalab. 

We use the Carpentries setup and approach to teaching and developing material.

This collection of episodes are not intended as a lesson in it self. It is a 
biggish bag of individual LEGO-bricks that can be assembled to quickly
create a new made-to-measure course whenever the need arises. 

In addition it serves as our repository of knowledge. When we encounter a 
question, we will add it to our list of episodes, in order to be able to refer
to it at a later date, when we have forgotten the answer. We try to do that
in the form of a teachable episode that can be reused.

If you want to make a new course based on this, consult the episode "Make a new course".
