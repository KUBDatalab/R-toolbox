Note. Bias er her et teknisk begreb. 
It's remarkable how often "bias" means "differs from my bias."

Clustering metoder

1. K-Means Clustering: 
This is a centroid-based algorithm, where the goal is to minimize the sum of distances between points and their respective cluster centroid.
2. Hierarchical Clustering: 
This method creates a tree of clusters. It is subdivided into Agglomerative (bottom-up approach) and Divisive (top-down approach).
3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): 
This algorithm defines clusters as areas of high density separated by areas of low density.
4. Mean Shift Clustering: 
It is a centroid-based algorithm, which updates candidates for centroids to be the mean of points within a given region.
5. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): 
This method uses a probabilistic model to represent the presence of subpopulations within an overall population without requiring to assign each data point to a cluster.
6. Spectral Clustering: 
It uses the eigenvalues of a similarity matrix to reduce dimensionality before applying a clustering algorithm, typically K-means.
7. OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure): 
Similar to DBSCAN, but creates a reachability plot to determine clustering structure.
8. Affinity Propagation: 
It sends messages between pairs of samples until a set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges.
9. BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies): 
Designed for large datasets, it incrementally and dynamically clusters incoming multi-dimensional metric data points.
10. CURE (Clustering Using Representatives): 
It identifies clusters by shrinking each cluster to a certain number of representative points rather than the centroid.
