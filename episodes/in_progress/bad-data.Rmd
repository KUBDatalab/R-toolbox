A collection of problems with data

Real world data is usually messy. Some of these problems have to be fixed by
the source of the data. Some can be fixed by you. Others you might need help
for.

This is a collection of some, perhaps most, of the problems we might encounter
in the real world.

## Problems that should be solved at the source

### Missing values

If a value is missing, ask youself: "Do I know why that value is missing?".
Did a respondent refuse to answer a 
question? Is it because it was never collected? If it was never collected, why?

### Zeroes replace missing values 

If a value is missing, at least we know that it _is_ missing. A worse situation
is if an arbitrary value is used to indicate, or even replace, a missing value.
It can happen because a human did not think about the implications, or because
automated datacollection did not know how to handle missing values. If you see
zeroes in your data, ask yourself if the value is truly 0. Or if someone or 
something added 0 to indicate a missing value. 

Other weird numbers might be used as well. The author of this text tended to 
use "999" to indicate that a measurement, that could only take values between
0 and 1, was missing. 

Remember that 0 might not present as "0". A false 0-value in a date-time format
will often appear as 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z or 1969-12-31T23:59:59Z because dates 
and times are regularly represented as a number of seconds since a specific
timestamp. For geographical data it might show up as 0degre00'00.0"N+0degree00'oo.o"E
or 0degreeN0degreeE. Automated systems might recognize a missing value, but 
impute it based on knowledge of the country by assigning it to a predetermined 
value for that country.

### Data is missing - but should be there

If you know what the data is about - you should do sanity checks on the data. If 
the data is about Danish municipalities, there should be 98 municipalities in
the data. That is, if it is current; reforms were made in 2003 and 2007, affecting 
the true number. If you have data on the US, there should be 50 states. But check
if US territories occur in the data. If Puerto Rico is included, 50 is not the 
correct number.



### Duplicated rows or values
### Inconsistent spelling
### Inconsistent name order
### Inconsistent date formats
### Unspecified units
### Bad choice for categories
### Ambiguous field names
### Uncertain provenance
### Presence of suspicious values
### To coarse data
### Aggregates or totals are inconsistent
### 65536 or 1048576 rows in the spreadsheet
### Spreadsheet dates in 1900, 1904, 1969 or 1970
### Text has been converted to numbers

## Problems that you should solve

### Garbled text
### Garbled line endings
### Data are in a PDF
### Too granular data
### Data entered by humans
### Data is intermingled with formatting and annotations
### Aggregations computed on missing values
### Non-random sample
### Too large margin of error
### Unknown margin of error
### Biased sample
### Manually edited data
### Data skewed by inflation
### Data skewd by season or natural variation
### Manipulated timeframe
### Manipulated frame of reference

## Someone else should probably help you
### Untrustworthy author
### Opaque collection process
### Data asserts unrealistic precision
### Inexplicable outliers
### Index masking underlying variation
### Suspected p-hacking
### Benford's law fails
### It's too good to be true
### data are aggregated to the wrong categories or geographies
### data are in scanned documents


can be fixed by
you. Others have to be fixed by the source of the data.
