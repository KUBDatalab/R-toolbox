A collection of problems with data

Real world data is usually messy. Some of these problems have to be fixed by
the source of the data. Some can be fixed by you. Others you might need help
for.

This is a collection of some, perhaps most, of the problems we might encounter
in the real world.

Vi skal nok have det delt op i to eller tre

## Problems that should be solved at the source

### Missing values
### Zeroes replace missing values 
### Data is missing - but should be there
### Duplicated rows or values
### Inconsistent spelling
### Inconsistent name order
### Inconsistent date formats
### Unspecified units
### Bad choice for categories
### Ambiguous field names
### Uncertain provenance
### Presence of suspicious values
### To coarse data
### Aggregates or totals are inconsistent
### 65536 or 1048576 rows in the spreadsheet
### Spreadsheet dates in 1900, 1904, 1969 or 1970
### Text has been converted to numbers

## Problems that you should solve

### Garbled text
### Garbled line endings
### Data are in a PDF
### Too granular data
### Data entered by humans
### Data is intermingled with formatting and annotations
### Aggregations computed on missing values
### Non-random sample
### Too large margin of error
### Unknown margin of error
### Biased sample
### Manually edited data
### Data skewed by inflation
### Data skewd by season or natural variation
### Manipulated timeframe
### Manipulated frame of reference

## Someone else should probably help you
### Untrustworthy author
### Opaque collection process
### Data asserts unrealistic precision
### Inexplicable outliers
### Index masking underlying variation
### Suspected p-hacking
### Benford's law fails
### It's too good to be true
### data are aggregated to the wrong categories or geographies
### data are in scanned documents


can be fixed by
you. Others have to be fixed by the source of the data.
